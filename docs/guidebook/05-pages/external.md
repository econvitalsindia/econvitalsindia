# External sector

**Purpose:** How are trade, the current account, capital flows, reserves and the rupee doing?

## Must include
- [x] Monthly merchandise exports, imports and trade balance (US$ bn, y/y), oil vs non-oil, gold imports
- [x] Services exports and imports (monthly, RBI actuals, not the Commerce projection)
- [x] Current account balance (quarterly, US$ bn and % GDP; monthly since 2026)
- [x] FX reserves (weekly) (import cover needs monthly imports)
- [x] REER and NEER: BIS broad indices (64 economies, 2020 = 100) as `reer_bis_broad`, `neer_bis_broad`. RBI's 40-currency Bulletin tables have no stable links (the archive form returns unrelated tables); switch if that changes
- [x] Net FDI, FPI flows, ECB registrations (`rbi/ecb.py`, monthly from Mar 2024)
- [x] Remittances: gross personal transfer receipts from the release text (`bop_remittances`, from Q3 2023-24); net secondary income stays in the BoP table
- [x] Chart: USD/INR with RBI reserve changes (weekly change bars, `reserves_change.json`)
- [x] External debt, US$ bn and % of GDP (`external_debt`, `external_debt_pct_gdp`; only the end-March and end-June releases are in RBI's index)

## Must NOT include
- Trade data in ₹ unless labelled (the default is US$)
- Commerce Ministry preliminary numbers presented as BoP numbers (they differ; label them)
