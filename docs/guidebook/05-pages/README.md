# 05 · Page checklists

One file per page. Every file uses the same sections:

- **Purpose**: the question the page answers, in one or two sentences.
- **Must include**: a checklist. Tick `[x]` when it is live and verified, and note the PR number.
- **Must NOT include**: the guard-rails.
- **Series**: ids from `registry/series/` (planned ids are in `registry/backlog.yaml`).
- **Layout and charts**: section order and chart types.
- **Done when**: the acceptance test for the page.
- **Phase**: when it is built.

The machine-readable twin of each file is `registry/pages/<page>.yaml`. When they disagree, fix the yaml to match this file, or update this file in the same PR.

## The menu
Every page and every `<h2>` section a reader might look for is in the header menu, defined in `site/src/lib/nav.js`. When you add a page or section, add it there. Give the `<h2>` a fixed `id` (e.g. `<h2 id="fuel">`) and link to `/page/#id`. Never link to an id derived from heading text that changes with the data (e.g. "Consumer prices, Sep 2026"). Search (Pagefind) indexes everything inside `<main>` automatically on `make build`.
