# 03 · Data sources catalogue

One row per **publisher/dataset**. Each indicator built from a source also has a `registry/series/*.yaml` that points back here.

**Status key:** `to-scout` = not yet checked · `scouted` = format, URL pattern, licence and access checked (date in Notes) · `live` = a series is in production.
**Access:** `auto` = works from GitHub Actions (US IP) · `manual` = needs a machine in India · `?` = untested.
**Licence:** `GODL` = Government Open Data Licence – India (redistribute with attribution) · `show-only` = display with attribution, no bulk download · `check` = unknown.

Every entry below is **`to-scout`**. The URLs are portal home pages, not verified endpoints. The Phase 0/1 source-scout pass fills in Format, URL pattern and Notes. Use `playbooks/scout-source.md`.

## Reachability probe: 2026-10-28

`scripts/probe_sources.py` fetched each portal's home page with browser headers, from India (this Mac) and from GitHub Actions (US). Raw results: `data/probes/*.json`. Re-run with the `probe-sources` workflow. **Home pages only**: a data endpoint can behave differently, so confirm per endpoint when scouting.

| Portal | India | Actions (US) | Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| MoSPI, eSankhyiki, Labour Bureau, NREGA, RBI (all three), CGA, PIB, indiabudget, Commerce, TradeStat, FBIL, CCIL, BSE, NSDL, AMFI, PPAC, DGCA, IMD, FCA prices, GST, World Bank API | 200 | 200 | `auto` candidates |
| EPFO | 200 | **403** | `manual` |
| Grid-India | 200 | **connection reset** | `manual` |
| CWC (reservoirs) | 200 | **401** | `manual` |
| NSE home page | 403 | 403 | Home page blocks scripts, but `nseindia.com/api/allIndices` returned 200 from both. Licensed: show-only |
| NPCI | 403 | 403 | Blocks scripts everywhere. Try a browser-like session or the PDF statistics pages; else manual entry |
| Yahoo chart API | 429 | 429 | Rate-limited without a session. Use the `yfinance` library (handles cookies) and test it |
| OEA / DPIIT (WPI, core) | SSL error | SSL error | **Fixed** 2026-10-28: missing intermediates fetched via AIA (`INCOMPLETE_CHAIN_HOSTS` in `core/http.py`) |

Small 200 responses (MoSPI 2.6 KB, eSankhyiki 1.2 KB, NREGA 0.5 KB, FBIL 1.5 KB) are JavaScript shells or redirects. Their data must come from API or file endpoints, not from parsing HTML.

## Official statistics

| Publisher | Datasets | Portal | Access | Licence | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MoSPI (NSO) | CPI (base 2024 + official back series to 2013, by state), IIP, NAS (GDP, base 2022-23; state GSDP growth, base 2011-12), PLFS (monthly/quarterly/annual, by state), WPI | REST API `https://api.mospi.gov.in/api/<product>/...` (no key). Specs: `https://esankhyiki.mospi.gov.in/layout/swagger_user_<cpi|iip|nas|plfs|wpi>.yaml`. Codes: MCP server `https://mcp.mospi.gov.in/mcp` tool `get_metadata` | auto | GODL (released under NDSAP/GSDD) | **live**: CPI, IIP, NAS quarterly, PLFS monthly | Scouted 2026-10-28. Needs TLS legacy renegotiation (handled in `core/http.py`). Max 100 rows/page (base 2012) or 200 (base 2024). CPI 2024 base uses COICOP 2018 divisions (no 'fuel and light' group). Back series covers the general index only. IIP: `iip/getIIPData` frequency=Monthly, base 2022-23 from Apr 2023, 2011-12 before; types General / Sectoral / Use-based category. NAS: `nas/getNASData` (indicators 5 GDP, 9-15 components, 21 GVA growth, 22 GDP growth; the old-base total row is called 'Total GVA Growth Rate'). PLFS: `plfs/getData` frequency_code=3 monthly from 2025, one indicator per call. CPI params: base_year, series (Current/Back), state_code (1 = All India for 2024; 99 for 2012), sector_code (1 R, 2 U, 3 C), division_code; 2012 base needs level=Group |
| Office of the Economic Adviser (DPIIT) | WPI (base 2022-23), Index of Core Industries (base 2022-23) | eaindustry.nic.in: `download_data_2223.asp` → `indx_download_2223/wpi_monthly_index_<yyyymm>.xlsx`; `ici_download_data.asp` → `eight_core_infra/Core_Industries_2022_23_<yyyymmdd>.xlsx` | auto | GODL | **live** (2026-10-28) | Monthly, around the 14th (WPI) and 20th (core). **The MoSPI API's WPI (`/api/wpi/getWpiRecords`) stops at April 2026 on the 2011-12 base (checked 2026-10-28), so WPI must come from OEA.** OEA's server sends only its leaf certificate; `core/http.py` walks the AIA chain (YR1 → Root YR cross-signed by ISRG Root X1) without partial-chain trust |
| Labour Bureau | CPI-IW (2016=100) | Latest press note linked on the home page (`uploads/public/notice/Press-Release-CPI-IW-<Month><Year>E….pdf`) | auto | GODL | **live** (2026-10-28) | No archive page, so history builds from each note (index for 2 months, inflation for the month and a year earlier). CPI-AL/RL (2019=100) press notes are linked the same way (to do) |
| EPFO | Net payroll additions | epfo.gov.in/data-hub/ (PDF per report month on pmvbry-cdn.epfindia.gov.in) | manual | GODL | **live** (`epfo/payroll.py`, Apr 2020 to Jul 2025) | epfindia.gov.in redirects to epfo.gov.in. Page 1 of each PDF has a row per month (`Jul-2025` + six age bands, total, establishments); the newest report printing a month wins. No report posted after September 2025 (checked 2026-10-29) |
| MGNREGA (MoRD) | Households demanding work, person-days | nrega.nic.in | ? | GODL | **deferred** | Report pages are slow and stateful (ASP.NET postbacks). Scout the MIS 'R1' / 'demand' reports or data.gov.in mirrors before building |

## RBI

| Dataset | Portal | Access | Licence | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RBI home page rates panel: repo/SDF/MSF, CRR/SLR, FBIL rates (1 pm today), benchmark G-sec yields, T-bill cut-offs, Sensex/Nifty closes | www.rbi.org.in | auto | unverified | **live** | Scouted 2026-10-28. Snapshot only (no history): we store one value per day. Footnotes give the 'as on' dates |
| DBIE time series (money, credit, rates, BoP, reserves, state finances) | data.rbi.org.in (moved from dbie.rbi.org.in, June 2024) | ? | check (RBI terms) | to-scout | No documented public API found. Scrape downloads. Note: the MoSPI API/MCP dataset `RBI` carries 39 RBI Handbook external-sector tables (trade, BoP, external debt, FX reserves monthly), but only to 2025, so it suits history, not the latest data |
| Weekly Statistical Supplement (WSS) | Archive per section: `rbi.org.in/Scripts/WSSViewDetail.aspx?TYPE=Section&PARAM1=<n>` (2 FX reserves, 3 SCB business, 4 ratios and rates, 7 money stock M3 (table 6), 8 reserve money (table 7), 25 liquidity operations (table 8), 1 RBI balance sheet; 13-23 CDs, CP, price indices, money-market turnover, T-bills, borrowings). The archive parameter is not the table number; weekly XLSX at `rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Wss/DOCs/<n>T_<ddmmyyyy><hash>.XLSX` | auto | unverified | **live** (sections 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 25) | Scouted 2026-10-28. Printed tables: rows matched by label, dates from headers. Earlier prints get revised (e.g. CRR for 28 Nov 2025 printed 3.00 then 3.25), so the latest print wins. The archive goes back years, so further backfill is possible. Layouts drift: older reserve-money files put the year one row lower, and Excel sometimes stores the day ("May 1") as a date with the wrong year, so only month and day are used; older liquidity files print dates as text. Fixtures for both in `tests/fixtures/rbi/wss/` |
| Press releases: external debt | press index, titles "India's External Debt as at the end of <Month> <YYYY>" | auto | unverified | **live** (`rbi/external_debt.py`) | Highlights give the level and change vs an earlier date (previous quarter, or a year earlier in March releases) and debt/GDP for both. Wording varies ("recording an increase"). The index lists only March and June releases for 2023-26 |
| Press releases: BoP remittances | quarterly BoP release text | auto | unverified | **live** (in `rbi/bop.py`) | "Personal transfer receipts ... rose to US$ X billion in Qn:YYYY-YY from US$ Y billion in Qn:YYYY-YY", printed since Q3 2024-25 |
| Press releases: MPC minutes | rbi.org.in press index (`_press.releases`, title starts "Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting") | auto | GODL | **live** (`rbi/mpc_minutes.py`, 62 meetings from Oct 2016) | Member titles vary ("Prof" without a dot, "Dr.Pami", no title for M. Rajeshwar Rao), so statements are matched to vote-table names, not parsed from headings. Some statements open with a section heading before paragraph 1. `rbi/mpc_decisions.py` reads the same minutes for the rate set (the "to/at N per cent" after the verb, never "from"), the stance (in the resolution; since 2025 after the outlook) and, since 2019, the size each member voted for. |
| Household Inflation Expectations Survey (IESH) | Press release 'RBI releases the results of Forward Looking Surveys' (via the index helper `pipelines/sources/rbi/_press.py`) → `PublicationsView.aspx?id=<n>` → `IESH….PDF`, Table 3 | auto | unverified | **live** (2026-10-28) | The same release links Consumer Confidence (UCCS/RCCS) and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (both **live**, `rbi_surveys`), plus OBICUS and the industrial outlook survey (candidates, same path). Older survey PDFs use other layouts; unparseable ones are skipped with a log line |
| Monetary Policy Report projections | rbi.org.in | ? | check | to-scout | Twice a year + each policy statement |

## Government finance

The dashboard workbook on the site stops at Feb 2026, so don't use it |
| GSTN / Ministry of Finance | GST gross/net collections; e-way bills; state-wise GST | `tutorial.gst.gov.in/offlineutilities/gst_statistics/Gross_Net_Tax_collection.xlsx` (one sheet per month) and `ewb-data-<fy>.xlsx`, listed at gst.gov.in/download/gststatistics | auto | GODL | **live** (collections; e-way bills via `gst/ewaybills.py`) | E-way bill files have one row per state and month; all-India = within-state + outgoing (incoming would double-count). Files 2018-19 to 2026-27, current year updated in place. The collections workbook lags the 1st-of-month press release by about two months. Sheet Jan-25 is malformed in the source (headers swapped), so it is skipped. Later sheets drop compensation cess |

Headings changed: CORPORATION TAX→CORPORATE TAX, INCOME TAX→TAXES ON INCOME OTHER THAN CORPORATE TAX; STT has its own head from FY 2023-24. Gross = sum of heads less NCCD (verified for FY 2023-24 and 2025-26). |
| CBDT / PIB | Direct tax collections | pib.gov.in press releases (irregular) | — | GODL | **not needed** | Finance Ministry listings sampled for Dec 2023 to Oct 2026 (allRel.aspx form, ministry 15) show no CBDT collection releases after April 2024. incometaxindia.gov.in returns 403 to scripts; not pursued. CGA tax heads cover this. |

PV only from Apr 2023 (Tata Motors included from then).
