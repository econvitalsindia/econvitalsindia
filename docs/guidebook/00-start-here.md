## What we are building

A dashboard of the Indian economy that updates every working day. It covers macro, financial and market indicators from public sources, adds a release calendar and downloadable data, and publishes briefings and a newsletter that AI drafts and a person approves. The audience is **economists and students**, so pages are dense, with methods notes and downloadable data.

The model is econvitals.org (U.S.). We credit it and do some things differently: a states view, an MPC member tracker, a base-year bridge, a monsoon and food watch, and Indian units and financial-year conventions. See `01-architecture.md` → "What makes us different".

## Roles

| Role | Does |
|---|---|
| **Maintainer** (project lead) | Sets priorities, approves briefings (merges PRs), owns the registry and the guidebook |
| **RA** | Runs `make india-update`, fixes scrapers, builds indicators and page sections from issues, verifies new series |
| **Coding agent** (Claude, Codex, …) | Same tasks as an RA, always via a playbook, always opening a PR. Never merges its own briefing PRs |

## 30-minute onboarding

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (5 min).
2. Read `01-architecture.md` and `02-conventions.md` (10 min).
3. Skim `05-pages/README.md` and the page you will work on (5 min).
4. `make setup && make check && make dev` and open the local site (10 min).
5. Pick an issue labelled `good-first-task` from the project board.

## Where we are

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Repo, config, guidebook, skills, CI skeleton, private preview | **in progress** |
| 1 | Pipeline core + ~25 core series + home dashboard + calendar + logo v1 | not started |
| 2 | All topic pages, detail pages, Data & Methods, downloads, status page, base-year bridge | not started |
| 3 | Briefings (ledger, drafts, approval PRs), newsletter, RSS | not started |
| 4 | Originals and tools: surprise composites, MPC Speak, States, monsoon watch, RBI policy rule, Budget explorer | not started |
| 5 | Go public: name and domain, legal pages, analytics, permission from Econvitals | not started |

Update this table when a phase closes. A phase closes only when its checklist in `10-launch-checklist.md` (for Phase 5) or the relevant page checklists (for Phases 1–4) are ticked, and the healthcheck shows zero overdue series.
